2019, I was able to complete my first marathon in 5 hours and 15 minutes. I trained for 3+ months and was an incredibly growing experience. Where I learn the importance of preperation and planning ahead.

It taught me much on sticking to the goal even if it feels out of reach. Walk if you need to, beleive in yourself and you will make it.

Running since has become a passion for me, I tend to take the easy road every time but with running I couldnt. I had to put one foot in front of the other and train the miles and build my endurance. It finally let me push myself and in turn, I can believe in myself more, it has been a pivotal point in my life where I gained true independenace.
